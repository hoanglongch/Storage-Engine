# Requirements and Architecture Specification

## 1. System Requirements

### 1.1 Performance Benchmarks
- **I/O Latency:**  
  - **Target:** Read/write latency of less than 100 microseconds.
  - **Measurement:** Use SPDKâ€™s built-in benchmarks and custom microbenchmarks.
- **Throughput:**  
  - **Target:** At least 10K IOPS or Y MB/s (tune these based on initial testing).
  - **Measurement:** Perform stress tests to simulate sustained I/O loads.
- **Concurrency:**  
  - **Goal:** Support 10K+ concurrent requests.
  - **Approach:** Utilize multi-threading, asynchronous I/O, and lock-free data structures.

### 1.2 Fault Tolerance, Data Durability, and Consistency
- **Fault Tolerance:**  
  - **Scenarios:** Disk failures, network partitions, and hardware glitches.
  - **Mechanisms:** Implement retry logic, graceful degradation, and failover strategies.
- **Data Durability:**  
  - **Target:** 99.999% durability under expected failure conditions.
  - **Mechanisms:** Use synchronous/asynchronous replication and persistent write confirmations.
- **Consistency Requirements:**  
  - **Model:** Define either strong, eventual, or tunable consistency.
  - **Mechanisms:** Use vector clocks for conflict resolution in replication; document the trade-offs.

### 1.3 Scalability Metrics
- **Concurrent Request Handling:**  
  - **Goal:** Handle at least 10K concurrent requests.
- **High Availability:**  
  - **Target:** 99.99% uptime.
- **Scalability Strategies:**  
  - **Horizontal Scaling:** Ability to add nodes.
  - **Vertical Scaling:** Utilize more powerful hardware if necessary.

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Component Dependencies
- **Modules:**
  - **Storage Engine:** SPDK-based, implements low-level I/O and NVMe optimizations.
  - **Distributed Cache:** RDMA-based, with a custom memory allocator and lock-free data structures.
  - **Replication Protocol:** Uses Protocol Buffers for message serialization, consistent hashing for node mapping, and vector clocks for conflict resolution.
  - **I/O Monitoring:** eBPF-based system for real-time monitoring of I/O performance.
- **Dependency Diagram:**  
  See the accompanying architecture diagram for a high-level view.

### 2.2 Middleware Considerations
- **Message Queue:**  
  - Evaluate options such as Kafka or RabbitMQ for decoupling module interactions and handling asynchronous events.
- **Centralized Logging:**  
  - Consider integrating the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or similar for consolidated log management and alerting.

### 2.3 Separation of Concerns
- **Networking Layer:**  
  - Isolate all network communication code into a dedicated module.
- **Error Handling Module:**  
  - Centralize error logging, error codes, and retry mechanisms.
- **Business Logic vs. Infrastructure:**  
  - Keep core business rules and data manipulation separate from infrastructure concerns like I/O, network communications, and logging.
